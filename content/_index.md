# Hi, I'm Namit üëã

I'm a data engineer based in Kolkata, designing fault-tolerant systems that turn noisy, unreliable data into decision-ready insights. I care deeply about *why* things work, not just *how*.

## What I'm working on

Lately, I've been leading efforts to replace fragile reporting chains with real-time dataflows using Python, Airflow, and AWS. I've cut manual processing by 20+ hours a week and raised visibility across global teams.

### üõ∞Ô∏è SpaceX Data Pipeline
**Problem:** Raw launch data lacked structure and visibility.  
**Solution:** Built automated ETL pipelines using Python and Airflow to analyze mission outcomes over time.  
**Key Skills:** Apache Airflow, REST APIs, data transformation, visualization
