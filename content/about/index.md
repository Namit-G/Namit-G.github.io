## Who I am  
I’m Namit, a data engineer based in Kolkata. I design fault-tolerant systems that turn noisy, unreliable data into decision-ready insights — and I care deeply about *why* things work, not just *how*.

## What I’m working on  
Lately, I’ve been leading efforts to replace fragile reporting chains with real-time dataflows using Python, Airflow, and AWS. I’ve cut manual processing by 20+ hours a week and raised visibility across global teams. I make trade-offs between speed and reliability, and treat data quality as a first-class citizen.

## What I’m curious about  
I'm diving into Palantir Foundry, LLM workflows, and ontology-driven modeling. I don’t just prototype — I productionize. I test ideas in the open, build tools that reflect user behavior, and document lessons with clarity so others can build better.

## Something human  
Outside data, I experiment with healthy food products (ask me about shirataki noodles) and often debug life using spreadsheets.

Take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/guptanamit864) or browse through real-world builds on [GitHub](https://github.com/Namit-G). I’m always open to jam on ideas, mentor newer devs, or swap stories about scaling things that break.
